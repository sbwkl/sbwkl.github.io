You can upgrade your operating system only if you have 32-bit processor running at 1 GHz or faster, at least 1GB RAM, and 16 GB free hard disk space, or a 64-bit processor running at 2 GHz or faster, at least 2 GB RAM, and at least 32 GB free hard disk space. Express you answer in terms of 

+ u: You can upgrade your operating system.
+ b<sub>32</sub>: You have a 32-bit processor.
+ b<sub>64</sub>: You have a 64-bit processor.
+ g<sub>1</sub>: Your processor runs at 1 GHz or faster.
+ g<sub>2<sub>: Your processor runs at 2 GHz or faster.
+ r<sub>1</sub>: Your processor has at least 1 GB RAM.
+ r<sub>2</sub>: Your processor has at least 2 GB RAM.
+ h<sub>16</sub>: You have at least 16 GB free hard disk space.
+ h<sub>32<sub>: You have at least 32 GB free hard disk space.

Solution

Form: p only if q

$$u \rightarrow ((b_{32} \wedge g_1 \wedge r_1 \wedge h_{16}) \vee (b_{64} \wedge g_2 \wedge r_2 \wedge h_{32}))$$
