The truth value of the disjunction of two propositions in fuzzy logic is the maximum of the truth values of the two propositions. What are the truth values of the statements "Fred is happy, or John is happy" and "Fred is not happy, or John is not happy"?

Solution

+ p: Fred is happy (0.8).
+ q: John is happy (0.4).


Fred is happy, or John is happy: $$p \vee q = max(0.8, 0.4) = 0.8$$

Fred is not happy, or John is not happy: $$\neg p \vee \neg q = max(0.2, 0.6) = 0.6$$
