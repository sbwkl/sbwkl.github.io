Let ```p```, ```q``` and ```r``` be the propositions

+ p: You get an A on the final exam.
+ q: You do every exercise in this book.
+ r: You get an A in this class.

Write these propositions using p, q and r and logical connectives (including negations).

1. You get an A in this class, but you do not do every exercise in this book.
2. You get an A on the final, you do every exercise in this book, and you get an A in this class.
3. To get an A in this class, it is necessary for you to get an A on the final.
4. You get an A on the final, but you don't do every exercise in this book; nevertheless, you get an A in this class.
5. Getting an A on the final and doing every exercise in this book is sufficient for getting an A in this class.
6. You will get an A in this class if and only if you either do every exercise in this book or you get an A on the final.

Solution

1. $$r \wedge \neg q$$
2. $$p \wedge q \wedge r$$
3. $$p \rightarrow r$$
4. $$p \wedge \neg q \wedge r$$
5. $$(p \wedge q) \rightarrow r$$
6. $$r \leftrightarrow (p \vee q)$$
