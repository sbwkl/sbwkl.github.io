**Fuzzy logic** is used in artificial intelligence. In fuzzy logic, a proposition has a truth value that is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. A proposition with a truth value of 0 is false and one with a truth value of 1 is true. Truth values that are between 0 and 1 indicate varying degrees of truth. For instance, the truth value 0.8 can be assigned to the statement "fred is happy," because Fred is happy most of the time, and the truth value 0.4 can be assighed to the statement "John is happy," because John is happy slightly less than half the time. Use these truth value to solve Exercises 49-51.

The truth value of the negation of a proposition in fuzzy logic is 1 minus the truth value of the proposition. What are the truth value of the statements "Fred is not happy" and "John is not happy"?

Solution

+ p: Fred is happy (0.8).
+ q: John is happy (0.4).

Fred is not happy = 1 - Fred is happy = 0.2

John is not happy = 1 - John is happy = 0.6
