Are these system specification consistent?

1. The system is in multiuser state if and only if it is operation normally.
1. If the system is operation normally, the kernel is functioning.
1. The kernel is not functioning or the system is in interrupt mode.
1. If the system is not in multiuser state, then it is in interrupt mode. 
1. The system is not in interrupt mode.

Solution

Not consistent

+ p: The system is in multiuser state.
+ q: The system is operating normally.
+ r: The kernel is functioning.
+ s: The system is in interrupt mode.

1. $$p \leftrightarrow q$$
2. $$q \rightarrow r$$
3. $$\neg r \vee s$$
4. $$\neg p \rightarrow s$$
5. $$\neg s$$

Equation 5 => s = F

Equation 3 => r = F

Equation 2 => q = F

Equation 1 => p = F

conflict with equation 4
