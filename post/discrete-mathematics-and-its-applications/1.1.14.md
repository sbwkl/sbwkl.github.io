Let ```p```, ```q```, and ```r``` be the propositions

+ p: You have the flu.
+ q: you miss the final examination.
+ r: You pass the course.

Express each of these propositions as an English sentence.

1. $$p \rightarrow q$$
2. $$\neg q \leftrightarrow r$$
3. $$q \rightarrow \neg r$$
4. $$p \vee q \vee r$$
5. $$(p \rightarrow \neg r) \vee (q \rightarrow \neg r)$$
6. $$(p \wedge q) \vee (\neg q \wedge r)$$

Solution

1. If you have the flu then you miss the final examination.
2. You not miss the final examination if and only if you have the flu.
3. if you miss the final examination then you can not pass the course.
4. you have the flu or you miss the final examination or you pass the course.
5. if you have the flu and you miss the final examination then you can not pass the course. ($$(p \wedge q) \rightarrow \neg r$$) 
6. you have the flu and you miss the final examination or you don not have the flu and you pass the course.
