Five friends have access to a chat room. Is it possible to determine who is chatting if the following information is known? Either Kevin or Heather, or both, are chatting. Either Randy or Vijay, but not both, are chatting. If Abby is chatting, so is Randy. Vijay and Kevin are either both chatting or neither is. If Heather is chatting, then so are Abby and Kevin. Explain your reasoning.

Solution

Kevin is chatting, Vijay is chatting.

+ $$p_1$$: Kevin is chatting.
+ $$p_2$$: Heather is chatting.
+ $$p_3$$: Randy is chatting.
+ $$p_4$$: Vijay is chatting.
+ $$p_5$$: Abby is chatting.

1. $$p_1 \vee p_2$$
1. $$p_3 \oplus p_4$$
1. $$p_5 \rightarrow p_3$$
1. $$(p_4 \wedge p_1) \vee (\neg p_4 \wedge \neg p_1)$$
1. $$p_2 \rightarrow (p_5 \wedge p_1)$$

Assign $$p_1 = F => p2 = T => p_5 \wedge p_1 = F$$ conflict.

Assign $$p_1 = T => p_4 = T => p_3 = F => p_5 = F = > p_2 = F$$
