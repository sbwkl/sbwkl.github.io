Are these system specifications consistent?

1. The router can send packets to the edge system only if it supports the new address space.
2. For the router to support the new address space it is necessary that the latest software release be installed.
3. The router can send packets to the edge system if the latest software release is installed.
4. The router does not support the new address space.

Solution

Consistent

+ p: The router can send packets to the edge system.
+ q: The router supports the new address space.
+ r: The latest software release be installed.

1. $$p \rightarrow q$$
2. $$q \rightarrow r$$
3. $$r \rightarrow p$$
4. $$\neg p$$

Equation 4 => p = F

Equation 3 => r = F

Equation 2 => q = F

Equation 1 = T
