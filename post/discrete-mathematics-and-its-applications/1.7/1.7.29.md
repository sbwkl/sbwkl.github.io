Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is odd if and only if 5n + 6 is odd.

Solution

+ p: n is odd.
+ q: 5n + 6 is odd.

**Proof $$p \rightarrow q$$**

n = 2k + 1, 5n + 6 = 5(2k + 1) + 6 = 10k + 11 = 2(5k + 5) + 1 is odd.

**Proof $$q \rightarrow p$$**

Assume p is false, n = 2k, 5n + 6 = 10k + 6 = 2(5k + 3) is even, q is false.
