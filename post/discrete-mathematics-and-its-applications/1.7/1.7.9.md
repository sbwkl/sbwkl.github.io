Use a proof by contradiction to prove the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational.

Solution

$$\neg p$$: The sum of an irrational number and a rational number is rational.

+ A is irrational number.
+ B is rational number B = m / n.
+ C is rational number C = r / s.

A + B = C

A = C - B = r / s - m / n = (nr - ms) / sn it is a rational.
