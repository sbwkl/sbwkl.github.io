Use Exercise 41 to show that if the first 10 positive integers are placed around a circle, in any order, there exist three integers in consecutive locations around the circle that have a sum greater than or equal to 17.

Solution

$$\begin{aligned}
& s_1 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \\
& s_2 = a_2 + a_3 + a_4 \\
& \text{...} \\
& s_{10} = a_{10} + a_1 + a_2
\end{aligned}$$

By Exercise 41 at least one $$s_i \ge (s_1 + s_2 + .. + s_{10}) / 10 = 3(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{10}) / 10 = 16.5$$
