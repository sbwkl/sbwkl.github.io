Show that these statements about the real number x are equivalent: (i) x is rational, (ii) x / 2 is rational, (iii) 3x - 1 is rational.

Solution

**Proof $$p_1 \rightarrow p_2$$**

x is rational, x = a / b, a, b are integers.

x / 2 = a / 2b it is rational.

**Proof $$p_2 \rightarrow p_3$$**

x / 2 is rational

$$\begin{aligned}
x / 2 = a / b \\
x = 2a / b \\
3x - 1 = 3(2a / b) - 1 = (6a - b) / b
\end{aligned}$$

It is rational.

**Proof $$p_3 \rightarrow p_1$$**

3x - 1 is ratiional.

$$\begin{aligned}
3x - 1 = a / b \\
x = (a - b) / 3b
\end{aligned}$$

It is rational.
