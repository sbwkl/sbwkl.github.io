Show that these statements about the real number x are equivalent: (i) x is irrational, (ii) 3x + 2 is irrational, (iii) x / 2 is irrational.

Solution

**Proof $$p_1 \rightarrow p_2$$**

Assume $$p_2$$ is false 

$$\begin{aligned}
& 3x + 2 = a / b \\
& x = (a - 2b) / 3b
\end{aligned}$$

It is ratiional.

**Proof $$p_2 \rightarrow p_3$$**

Assume $$p_3$$ is fasle

$$\begin{aligned} 
& x / 2 = a / b \\
& x = 2a / b \\
& 3x + 2 = 3(2a / b) + 2 = (6a + 6b) / b
\end{aligned}$$

It is rational.

**Proof $$p_3 \rightarrow p_1$$**

Assume $$p_1$$ is false

$$\begin{aligned}
& x = a / b \\
& 3x + 2 = 3a / b + 2 = (3a + 2b) /b
\end{aligned}$$

It is rational.
