Is this reasoning for finding the solutions of the equation $$\sqrt{2x^2 - 1} = x$$ correct? (1) $$\sqrt{2x^2 - 1} = x$$ is given;
(2) $$2x^2 - 1 = x^2$$, obtained by squaring both sides of (1); (3) $$x^2 - 1 = 0$$, obbtained by subtracting $$x^2$$ from both sides of (2); (4) (x - 1)(x + 1) = 0, obtained by factoring the left-hand side of $$x^2 - 1$$; (5) x = 1 or x = -1, which follows because ab = 0 implies that a = 0 or b = 0.
