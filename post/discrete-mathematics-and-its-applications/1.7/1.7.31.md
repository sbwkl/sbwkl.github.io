Prove or disprove that if m and n are integers such that mn = 1, then either m = 1 and n = 1 or else m = -1 and n = -1.

Solution

+ p: mn = 1
+ q: $$m = 1 \vee m = -1$$

Assume q is false, that is $$m \ne 1 \wedge m \ne -1$$, mn has factor m large than 1 but 1 has no such factor.

m = 1, n = 1

m = -1, n = -1
