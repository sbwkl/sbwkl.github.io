Prove that if n is an integer, these four statements are equivalent: (i) n is even, (ii) n + 1 is odd, (iii) 3n + 1 is odd, (iv) 3n is even.

Solution

**Proof $$p_1 \rightarrow p_2$$**

n = 2k, n + 1 = 2k + 1, it is odd.

**Proof $$p_2 \rightarrow p_3$$**

n + 1 = 2k + 1, n = 2k, 3n + 1 = 2(3k) + 1, it is odd.

**Proof $$p_3 \rightarrow p_4$$**

3n + 1 = 2k + 1, 3n = 2k, it is even.

**Proof $$p_4 \rightarrow p_1$$**

Assume n is odd, n = 2k + 1, 3n = 3(2k + 1) = 2(3k + 1) + 1, it is odd.
