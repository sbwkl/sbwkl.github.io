Use a proof by contradiction to show that there is no rational number r for which $$r^3 + r + 1 = 0$$. [Hint: Assume that r = a / b is a root, where a and b are integers and a / b is in lowest terms. Obtain an equation involving integers by multiplying by $$b^3$$. Then look at whether a and b are each odd or even.]

Solution

Proof by Contradiction

p: There is no retional number r for which $$r^3 + r + 1 = 0$$.

Assume p is false, there is a retional number r = a / b, a, b have no common factors.

$$\begin{aligned}
& (a / b)^3 + (a / b) + 1 = 0 \\
& a^3 + ab^2 + b^3 = 0
\end{aligned}$$

if interger i is odd, then $$i^2$$ is odd and $$i^3$$ is odd.

if interger i is even, then $$i^2$$ is even and $$i^3$$ is even.

Assume a, b is odd 

$$\begin{aligned}
& a = 2m + 1 \\
& a^3 = 2n + 1 \\
& b^2 = 2r + 1 \\
& b^3 = 2t + 1
\end{aligned}$$

2n + 1 + (2m + 1)(2r + 1) + 2t + 1 = 0

2(n + 2mr + m + r + t) = -3, it is contradiction.

a, b are even, have common factor 2, $$\neg p$$ leads to the contradiction that 2 divides both a and b and 2 does not divide both a and b.
