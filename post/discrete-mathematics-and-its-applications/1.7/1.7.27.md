Use a proof by contradiction to show that there is no rational number r for which $$r^3 + r + 1 = 0$$. [Hint: Assume that r = a / b is a root, where a and b are integers and a / b is in lowest terms. Obtain an equation involving integers by multiplying by $$b^3$$. Then look at whether a and b are each odd or even.]
