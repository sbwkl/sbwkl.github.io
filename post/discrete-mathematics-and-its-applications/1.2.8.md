Express these system specifications using the proposition

+ p: The user enters a valid password.
+ q: Access is granted
+ r: The user has paid the subscription fee

and logical connectives (including negations).

1. The user has paid the subscription fee, but does not enter a valid password.
2. Access is granted whenever the user has paid the subscription fee and enters a valid password.
3. Access is denied if the user has not paid the subscription fee.
4. If the user has not entered a valid password but has paid the subscription fee, then access is granted.

Solution

1. $$r \wedge \neg p$$
2. $$(r \wedge p) \rightarrow q$$
3. $$\neg r \rightarrow \neg q$$
4. $$(\neg p \wedge r) \rightarrow q$$
