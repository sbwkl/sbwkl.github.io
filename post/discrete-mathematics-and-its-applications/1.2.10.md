Are these system specifications consistent?

1. Whenever the system software is being upgraded, users cannot access the file system.
2. If users can access the file system, then they can save new files.
3. If users cannot save new files, then the system software is not being upgraded.

Solution

Consistent

+ p: The system software is being upgraded.
+ q: Users can access the file system.
+ r: Users can save new files.

1. $$p \rightarrow \neg q$$
2. $$q \rightarrow r$$
3. $$\neg r \rightarrow \neg p$$

Assign p = T

Equation 1 => q = F

Equation 3 => r = F

Equation 2 = T
