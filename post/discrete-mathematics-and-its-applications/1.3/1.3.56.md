Show that {$$\vert$$} is a functionally complete collection of logical operators.

Solution

$$\neg p \equiv \neg (p \wedge p) \equiv p \;\vert \; p$$

$$p \wedge q \equiv \neg (p \;\vert\; q) \equiv (p \;\vert\; q) \;\vert\; (p \;\vert\; q)$$

By Exercise 48, Given a compound propositon p, we can write down a proposition q that is logically equivalent p and involves only $$\neg$$ and $$\wedge$$, we can eliminate all $$\neg s$$ by replacing each occurrence of $$\neg p_1$$ with $$p \;\vert\; p$$, and eliminate all $$\wedge s$$ by replacing each occurrence of $$p_1 \wedge p_2$$ with $$(p \;\vert\; q) \;\vert\; (p \;\vert\; q)$$, $$p_1, p_2$$ can be compound proposition.
