Find a compound proposition involving the propositional variables p, q, and r that is true when exactly two of p, q, and r are true and is false otherwise. [Hint: Form a disjunction of conjunctions. Include a conjunction for each combination of values for which the compound proposition is true. Each conjunction should include each of the three propositional variables or its negations.]
