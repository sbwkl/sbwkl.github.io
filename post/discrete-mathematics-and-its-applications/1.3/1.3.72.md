Explain the steps in the construction of the compound proposition given in the text that asserts that each of the nine 3 * 3 blocks of a 9 * 9 Sudoku puzzle contains every number.

Solution

$$\bigwedge_{r=0}^2 \bigwedge_{c=0}^2 \bigwedge_{n=1}^9 \bigvee_{i=1}^3 \bigvee_{j=1}^3p(3r+i, 3c+j)$$

For every block $$\bigwedge_{n=1}^9 \bigvee_{i=1}^3 \bigvee_{j=1}^3p(3r+i, 3c+j)$$
