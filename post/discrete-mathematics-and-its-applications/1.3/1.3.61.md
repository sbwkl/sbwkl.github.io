The following sentence is taken from the specification of a telephone system: "If the directory database is opened, then the monitor is put in a closed state, if the system is not in its initial state." This specification is hard to understand because it involves two conditional statements. Find an equivalent, easier-to-understand specification that involves disjunctions and negations but not conditional statements.

Solution

The directory database is not opened, or the monitor is put in a closed state, or the system is in its initial state.

+ p: The directory database is opened.
+ q: The monitor is put in a closed state.
+ r: The system is in its initial state.

$$\begin{aligned}
(p \wedge \neg r) \rightarrow q 
&\equiv \neg (p \wedge \neg r) \vee q 
&\equiv \neg p \vee r \vee q \\
&\equiv p \rightarrow (r \vee q)
\end{aligned}$$
