The truth value of the conjunction of two propositions in fuzzy logic is the minimum of the truth values of the two propositions. What are the truth values of the statements "Fred and John are happy" and "Neither Fred nor John is happy"?

Solution

+ p: Fred is happy (0.8).
+ q: John is happy (0.4).

Fred and John are happy: $$p \wedge q = min(0.8, 0.4) = 0.4$$

Neither Fred nor John is happy: $$\neg p \wedge \neg q = min(0.2, 0.6) = 0.2$$
