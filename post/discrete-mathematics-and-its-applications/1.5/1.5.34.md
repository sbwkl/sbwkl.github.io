Find a common domain for the variables x, y, z for which the statement $$\forall x \forall y ((x \ne y) \rightarrow \forall z ((z = x) \vee (z = y)))$$ is true and another domian for which it is false.

Solution

Domain for true: {1, 2}, element is two.

Domain for false: {1, 2, 3}, element bigger than two.
