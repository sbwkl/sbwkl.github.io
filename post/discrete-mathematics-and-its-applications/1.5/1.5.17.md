Express each of these system specifications using predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives, if necessary.

1. Every user has access to exactly one mailbox.
2. There is a process that continues to run during all error conditions only if the kernel is working correctly.
3. All users on the campus network can access all websites whose url has a .edu extension.
4. There are exactly two systems that monitor every remote server.

Solution

a. $$\forall x \exist y \exist z (y = z \leftrightarrow (A(x, y) \wedge A(x, z)))$$

+ Domain: x - All users, y - All mailbox.
+ A(x, y): x can access y.

b. $$(\exist x \forall y R(x, y)) \rightarrow p$$

+ Domain: x - All processes, y - All error conditions.
+ R(x, y): x is continues to run during y.
+ p: The kernel is working correctly.

c. $$\forall x \forall y A(x, y)$$

+ Domain: x - All users on the campus network, y - All websites whose url has a .edu extension.
+ A(x, y): x can access y.

d. $$\exist x_1 \exist x_2 \exist x_3 \forall y ((x_1 = x_2 \vee x_1 = x_3) \leftrightarrow M(x_1, y) \wedge M(x_2, y) \wedge (x_3, y)))$$

+ Domain: x - All systems, y - All remote servers.
+ M(x, y): x monitor y.
