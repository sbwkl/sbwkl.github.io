A statement is in **prenex normal form (PNF)** is and only if it is of the form 

$$Q_1x_1Q_2x_2...Q_kX_kP(x_1, x_2,..., x_k)$$,

where each $$Q_i$$, i = 1, 2, ..., k, is either the existential quantifier or the universal quantifier, and $$P(x_1,..., x_k)$$ is apredicate involving no quantifiers. For example, $$\exist x \forall y (P(x, y) \wedge Q(y))$$ is in prenex normal form, whereas $$\exist x P(x) \vee \forall x Q(x) is not (because the quantifiers do not all occur first).

Every statement formed form propositional variables, predicates, T, and F using logical connectives and quantifiers is equivalent to a statement in prenex normal form. Exercise 51 ask for a proof of this fact.

**50.** Put these statements in prenex normal form. [Hint: Use logical equivalence from Tables 6 and 7 in Section 1.3, Table 2 in Section 1.4, Example 19 in Section 1.4, Exercises 47 and 48 in Section 1.4, and Exercises 48 and 49.]

1. $$\exist x P(x) \vee \exist x Q(x) \vee A$$, where A is a proposition not involving any quantifiers.
2. $$\neg (\forall x P(x) \vee \forall x Q(x))$$
3. $$\exist x P(x) \rightarrow \exist x Q(x)$$
