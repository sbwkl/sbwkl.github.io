Solution

a. $$\exist x S(x, Hindi)$$

+ Domain: All students in this class.
+ S(x, y): x can speak y.

b. $$\forall x \exist y P(x, y)$$

+ Domain: x = All students in this class, y = All sport.
+ P(x, y): x plays y.

c. $$\exist x (V(x, Alaska) \wedge \neg V(x, Hawaii))$$

+ Domain: x = All students in this class
+ V(x, y): x has visited y.

d. $$\forall x \exist y L(x, y)$$

+ Domain: x = All students in this class, y = All programming language.
+ L(x, y): x learned y.

e. $$\exist x \forall y T(x, y)$$

+ Domain: x = All students in this class, y = All courses offered by one of the departments in this school.
+ T(x, y): x taken y.

f. $$\exsit x_1 \exist x_2 \exist y (x_1 \ne x_2 \wedge G(x_1, y) \wedge G(x_2, y))$$

+ Domain: x = All students in this class, y = All towns.
+ G(x, y): x grew up in y.

g. $$\exist x \exist y \exist z (x \ne y \wedge G(x, z) \wedge C(x, y))$$

+ Domain: x,y = All students in this class, z = All chat groups.
+ C(x, y): x has chatted y.
+ G(x, z): x in chat group z.
