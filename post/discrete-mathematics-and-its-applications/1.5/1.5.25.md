Translate each of these nested quantifications in to an English statement that expresses a mathematical fact. The domain in each case consists of all real numbers.

1. $$\exist x \forall y (xy = y)$$
2. $$\forall x \forall y (((x \lt 0) \wedge (y \lt 0)) \rightarrow (xy \gt 0))$$
3. $$\exist x \exist y ((x^2 \gt y) \wedge (x \lt y))$$
4. $$\forall x \forall y \exist z (x + y = z)$$

Solution

1. There is a real number x, for every real number y that xy = y.
2. The product of two negative real number is positive.
3. There are two real number, the one less than the other but the square is bigger than the other.
4. The sum of two real number is real number.
