Let C(x, y) mean that student x is enrolled in class y, where the domain for x consists of all students in your school and the domain for y consists of all classes being given at your school. Express each of these statements by a simple English sentence.

1. C(Randy Goldberg, CS 252)
1. $$\exist x C(x, Math 695)$$
1. $$\exist y C(carol Sitea, y)$$
1. $$\exist x (C(x, Math 222) \wedge C(x, CS 252))$$
1. $$\exist x \exist y \forall z ((x \ne y) \wedge (C(x, z) \rightarrow C(y, z)))$$
1. $$\exist x \exist y \forall z ((x \ne y) \wedge (C(x, z) \leftrightarrow C(y, z)))$$
