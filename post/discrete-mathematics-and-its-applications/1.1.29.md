State the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of each of these conditional statements.

1. If it snows today, I will ski tomorrow.
2. I come to class whenever there is going to be a quiz.
3. A positive integer is a prime only if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Solution

a. if p, q

+ p: It snows today.
+ q: I will ski tomorrow.

|--|--|
|converse|If I will ski tomorrow, then it snows today.|
|contrapositive|If I will not ski tomorrow, then it does not snows today.|
|inverse|If it does not snows today, then I will not ski tomorrow|

b. q whenever p

+ p: There is going to be a quiz.
+ q: I come to class.

|converse|If I come to class, then there is going to be a quiz.|
|contrapositive|If I don't come to class, then there is not going to be a quiz.|
|inverse|If there is not gong to be a quiz, then I don't come to class.|

c. p only if q

+ p: A positive integer is a prime.
+ q: It has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

|--|--|
|converse|If it has no divisors other than 1 and itself, then a positive integer is a prime.|
|contrapositive|If a positive integer has divisors other than 1 and itself, then it is not a prime.|
|inverse|If a positive integer is not a prime, then it has divisors other than 1 and itself.|
