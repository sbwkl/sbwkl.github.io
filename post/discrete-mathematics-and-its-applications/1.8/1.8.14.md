Show that the product of two of the numbers $$65^{1000} - 8^{2001} + 3^{177}$$, $$79^{1212} - 9^{2399} + 2^{2001}$$, and $$24^{4493} - 5^{8192} + 7^{1777}$$ is nonegative. Is your proof constructive or nonconstructive? [Hint: Do not try to evaluate these numbers!]

Solution

(i) At least one of the numbers is 0, the product is 0, it is nonnegative.

(ii) All numbers are nonzero, at least two of the numbers have the same sign, the product is nonnegative.

non-constructive.
