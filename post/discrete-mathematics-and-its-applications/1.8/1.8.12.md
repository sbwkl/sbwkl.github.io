Prove that either $$2*10^500 + 15$$ or $$2*10^500 + 16$$ is not a perfect square. Is your proof constructive or nonconstructive?

Solution

Assume $$2*10^500 + 15 = n^2, n \gt 1$$, the next integer is n + 1

$$(n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 \ge n^2 + 1$$, so $$2*10^500 + 16 is not perfect.

nonconstructive.
