Use a proof by cases to show that min(a, min(b, c)) = min(min(a, b), c) whereever a, b, and c are real number.

Solution

(i) $$a \ge b \ge c, min(b, c) = c, min(a, c) = c. min(a, b) = b, min(b, c) = c$$.

(ii) $$a \ge c \ge b, min(b, c) = b, min(a, b) = b. min(a, b) = b, min(b, c) = b$$.

... 

The same as other case.
