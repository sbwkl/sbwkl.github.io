Let P(x) be the statement "x can speak Russian" and let Q(x) be the statement "x knows the computer language C++." Express each of these sentences in terms of P(x), Q(x), quantifiers, and logical connectives. The domain for quantifiers consists of all students at your school.

1. There is a student at your school who can speak Russian and who knows C++.
1. There is a student at your school who can speak Russian but who doesn't know C++.
1. Every student at your school either can speak Russian or knows C++.
1. No student at your school can speak Russian or knows C++.

Solution

1. $$\exist x (P(x) \wedge Q(x))$$
1. $$\exist x (P(x) \wedge \neg Q(x))$$
1. $$\forall x (P(x) \vee Q(x))$$
1. $$\neg \exist x (P(x) \vee Q(x))$$
