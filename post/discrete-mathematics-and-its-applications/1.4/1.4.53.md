Show that $$\exist x P(x) \wedge \exist x Q(x)$$ and $$\exist x (P(x) \wedge Q(x))$$ are not logically equivalent.

Solution

Assign domain consists of $$x_1, x_2$$

when

$$\begin{cases}
P(x_1) = T \\
P(x_2) = F \\
Q(x_1) = F \\
Q(x_2) = T \\
\end{cases}$$ it has different truth value.
