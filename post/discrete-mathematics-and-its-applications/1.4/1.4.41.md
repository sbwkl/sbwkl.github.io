Translate these specifications into English, where F(p) is "Printer p is out of service," and B(p) is "Printer p is busy," L(j) is "Print job j is lost," and Q(j) is "Print job j is queued."

1. $$\exist p (F(p) \wedge B(p) ) \rightarrow \exist j L(j)$$
2. $$\forall p B(p) \rightarrow \exist j Q(j)$$
3. $$\exist j (Q(j) \wedge L(j)) \rightarrow \exist p F(p)$$
4. $$(\forall p B(p) \wedge \forall j Q(j)) \rightarrow \exist j L(j)$$

Solution

1. When there is a printer out of service and busy, a print job is lost.
2. If all printer is busy, then there is a print job queued.
3. If there is a print job queued and lost, then there is a printer out of service.
4. If all printer is busy and all print job is queued, then there is a print job lost.
