Let C(x) be the statement "x has a cat," let D(x) be the statment "X has a dog," and let F(x) be the statement "x has a ferret." Express each of these statements in terms of C(x), D(x), F(x), quantifiers, and logical connectives. Let the domain consist of all students in your class.

1. A student in your class has a cat, a dog, and a ferret.
1. All student in your class have a cat, a dog or a ferret.
1. Some student in your class has a cat and a ferret, but not a dog.
1. No student in your class has a cat, a dog, and a ferret.
1. For each of the three animals, cats, dogs, and ferrets, there is a student in your class who has this animal as a pet.

Solution

1. $$\exist x (C(x) \wedge D(x) \wedge F(x))$$
1. $$\forall x (C(x) \vee D(x) \vee F(x))$$
1. $$\exist x (C(x) \wedge F(x) \wedge \neg F(x))$$
1. $$\neg \exist x (C(x) \wedge F(x) \wedge D(x))$$
1. $$\exist x (C(x) \vee D(x) \vee F(x))$$
