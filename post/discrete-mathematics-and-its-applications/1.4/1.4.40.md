Exercises 40-44 deal with the translation between system specification and logical expressions involving quantifiers.

**40.** Translate these system specifications into English, where the predicate S(x,y) is "x is in state y" and where the domain for x and y consists of all systems and all possible states, respectively.

1. $$\exist x S(x, open)$$
2. $$\forall x (S(x, malfunctioning) \vee S(x, diagnostic))$$
3. $$\exist x S(x, open) \vee \exist x S(x, diagnostic)$$
4. $$\exist x \neg S(x, available)$$
5. $$\forall x \neg S(x, working)$$
