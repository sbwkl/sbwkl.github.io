Express each of these system specifications using predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives.

1. Every user has access to an electronic mailbox.
2. The system mailbox can be accessed by everyone in the group if the file system is locked.
3. The firewall is in a diagnostic state only if the proxy server is in a diagnostic state.
4. At least one router is functioning normally if the throughput is between 100 kbps and 500 kbps and the proxy server is not in diagnostic mode.

Solution

a. $$\forall u A(u)$$

+ A(u): u has access to an electronic mailbox.

b. $$\exist s L(s) \rightarrow \forall u (G(u) \rightarrow A(u))$$

+ L(s): x is locked.
+ A(u): User u can access the system mailbox.
+ G(u): u in the group.

c. $$\exist f S(f) \rightarrow \exist s D(s)$$

+ S(f): f is in a diagnostic state.
+ D(s): s is in a diagnostic state.

d. $$(T(100, 500) \wedge \exist s \neg M(s)) \rightarrow \exist r N(r)$$

+ N(r): Router r is functioning normally.
+ T(x, y): The throughput is between x kbps and y kbps.
+ M(s): The proxy server s is in diagnostic mode.
