Determine whether each of these arguments is valid. If an argument is correct, what rule of inference is being used? If it is not, what logical error occurs?

1. If n is a real number such that n > 1, then n^2 > 1. Suppose that n^2 > 1. Then n > 1.
2. If n is a real number with n > 3, then n^2 > 9. Suppose that n^2 <= 9. Then n <= 3.
3. If n is a real number with n > 2, then n^2 > 4. Suppose that n <= 2. Then n^2 <= 4.

Solution

1. Incorrect. Fallacy of affirming the conclusion.
2. Correct.
3. Incorrect. Fallacy of denying the hypothesis.
