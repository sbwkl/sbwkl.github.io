Determine whether this argument, taken from Kalish and Montague [KaMo64], is valid.

If Superman were able and willing to prevent evil, he would do so. If Superman were unable to prevent evil, he would be impotent; if he were unwilling to prevent evil, he would be malevolent.

Solution

+ p: Superman were able to prevent evil.
+ q: Superman will to prevent evil.
+ r: Superman would be impotent.
+ s: Superman would be malevolent.
+ t: Superman exist.
