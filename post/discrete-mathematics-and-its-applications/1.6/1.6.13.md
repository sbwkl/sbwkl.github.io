For each of these arguments, explain which rules of inference are used for each step.

1. "Doug, a student in this class, knows how to write programs in JAVA. Everyone who knows how to write programs in JAVA can get a high-paying job. Therefore, someone in this class can get a high-paying job."
2. "Somebody in this class enjoys whale watching. Every person who enjoys whale watching cares about ocean pollution. Therefore, there is a person in this class who cares about ocean pollution."
3. "Each of the 93 students in this class owns a personal computer. Everyone who owns a personal computer can use a word processing program. Therefore, Zeke, a student in this class, can use a word processing program."
4. "Everyone in New Jeersey lives within 50 miles of the ocean. Someone in New Jersey has never seen the ocean. Therefore, someone who lives within 50 miles of the ocean has never seen the ocean."

Solution

1. Universal instantiation, Modus ponens, Existential generalization.
   1. $$P(Doug)$$
   2. $$\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow H(x))$$
   3. $$H(Doug)$$
   4. $$\exist x H(x)$$
2. Universal instantiation, Modus ponens, Existential generalization.
   1. $$\exist (C(x) \wedge E(x))$$
   2. $$\forall x (E(x) \rightarrow P(x))$$
   3. $$C(a) \wedge P(a)$$
   4. $$\exist x (C(x) \wedge P(x))$$
3. Universal instantiation, Hypothetical syllogism.
   1. $$\forall x (S(x) \rightarrow O(x))$$
   2. $$\forall x (O(x) \rightarrow P(x))$$
   3. $$S(Zeke) \rightarrow P(Zeke)$$
4. Universal instantiation, Simplification, Existential generalization.
   1. $$\forall x (N(x) \rightarrow L(x))$$
   2. $$\exist x (N(x) \wedge \neg S(x))$$
   3. $$L(a) \wedge \neg S(a)$$
   4. $$\exist x (L(x) \wedge \neg S(x))$$
