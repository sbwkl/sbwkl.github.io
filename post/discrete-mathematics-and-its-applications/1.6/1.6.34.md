The Logic Problem, token from WFF'N PROFF, The Game of Logic, has these two assumptions: 
1. "Logic is difficult or not many students like logic."
2. "If mathematics is easy, then logic is not difficult."

By translating these assumptions into statements involving propositional variables and logical connectives, determine whether each of the following are valid conclusions of these assumptions:

1. That mathematics is not easy, if many studnets like logic.
2. That not many students like logic, if mathematics is not easy.
3. That mathematics is not easy or logic is difficult.
4. That logic is not difficult or mathematics is not easy.
5. That if not many students like logic, then either mathematics is not easy or logic is not difficult.

Solution

1. Valid
2. Invalid
3. Invalid
4. Invalid
5. Valid

+ p: Logic is difficult.
+ q: Many studnet like logic.
+ r: Mathematics is easy.

Premise
1. $$p \vee \neg q$$
2. $$r \rightarrow \neg p$$
