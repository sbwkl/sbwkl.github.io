Explain, without using a truth table, why $$(p \vee q \vee r) \wedge (\neg p \vee \neg q \vee \neg r) is true when at least one of p, q, and r is true and at least one is false, but is false when all three variables have the same truth value.

Solution

1. $$p \vee q \vee r$$ = T
2. $$\neg p \vee \neg q \vee \neg r$$ = T

Equation 1 is T if and only if at least one of p, q, and r is true.

Equation 2 is T if and only if at least one of p, q, and r is false.
