What is the value of x after each of these statements is encountered in computer program, if x = 1 before the statement is reached?

1. if x + 2 = 3 then x := x + 1
2. if (x + 1 = 3) OR (2x + 2 = 3) then x := x + 1
3. if (2x + 3 = 5) AND (3x + 4 = 7) then x := x + 1
4. if (x + 1 = 2) XOR (x + 2 = 3) then x := x + 1
5. if x < 2 then x : x + 1

Solution

1. x = 2
2. x = 1
3. x = 2
4. x = 1
5. x = 2
