Exercises 23-27 relate to inhabitants of the island of knights and knaves created by Smullyan, where knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. You encounter two people, A and B. Determine, if possible, what A and B are if they address you in the ways described, If you cannot determine what these two people are, can you draw any conclusions?

+ p: A is knight.
+ q: B is knight.

**23.** A say "At least one of us is a knave" and B say nothing.

Solution 

1. A is knight, B is knave.

Assign p = T => $$\neg p \vee \neg q = T$$ => q = F.

Assign p = F => $$\neg p \vee \neg q = F$$ conflict.

**24.** A says "The two of us are both knights" and B says "A is a knave."

Solution

1. A is knave, B is knight.

Assign p = T $$p \wedge q = T$$ => q = T => $$\neg p = T$$ conflict.

Assign p = F, q = T => $$p \wedge q = F$$, $$\neg p = T$$.

Assign p = F, q = F => $$p\wedge q = F$$, $$\neg p = F$$ conflict.

**25.** A says "I am a knave or B is a knight" and B says nothing.

Solution

1. A is knight, B is knight.

Assign p = T => $$\neg p \vee q = T$$ => q = T

Assign p = F => $$\neg p \vee q = F$$ conflict

**26.** Both A and B say "I am a knight"

Solution

1. A is knight, B is knight.
2. A is knight, B is knave.
3. A is knave, B is knight.
4. A is knave, B is knave.

Assign p = T, q = T => $$p = T$$, $$q = T$$.

Assign p = T, q = F => $$p = T$$, $$q = F$$.

Assign p = F, q = T => $$p = F$$, $$q = T$$.

Assign p = F, q = F => $$p = F$$, $$q = F$$.

**27.** A says "We are both knaves" and B says nothing.

Solution

1. A is knave, B is knave.

Assign p = T => $$\neg p \wedge \neg q = T$$ conflict.

Assign p = F => $$\neg p \wedge \neg q = F$$ => q = F
