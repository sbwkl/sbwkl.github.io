Steve would like to determine the relative salaries of three coworkers using two facts. First, he knows that if Fred is not the highest paid of the three, then Janice is. Second, he knows that if Janice is not the lowest paid, then Maggie is paid the most. Is it possible to determine the relative salaies of Fred, Maggie, and Janice from what Steve knows? if so, who is paid the most and who the least? Explain your resoning.

Solution

Fred is hightest, Janice is lowest.

+ $$p_1$$: Fred is highest.
+ $$P_2$$: Maggie is highest.
+ $$p_3$$: Janice is highest.
+ $$q_1$$: Fred is lowest.
+ $$q_2$$: Maggie is lowest.
+ $$q_3$$: Janice is lowest.

1. $$\neg p_1 \rightarrow p_3$$
1. $$\neg q_3 \rightarrow p_2$$
1. $$\neg p_i \vee \neg q_i$$
1. $$(\neg p_1 \vee \neg p_2) \wedge (\neg p_1 \vee \neg p_3) \wedge (\neg p_2 \vee \neg p_3) \wedge (p_1 \vee p_2 \vee p_3)$$
1. $$(\neg q_1 \vee \neg q_2) \wedge (\neg q_1 \vee \neg q_3) \wedge (\neg q_2 \vee \neg q_3) \wedge (q_1 \vee q_2 \vee q_3)$$

Equation 4 means: Exact one true for $$p_1, p_2, p_3$$.

Assign $$p_1 = F => p_3 = T => q_3 = F = > p_2 = T$$ conflict with Equation 4.

Assign $$p_1 = T => p_2 = F => q_3 = T$$.
