A detective has interviewed four witnesses to a crime. From the stories of the witnesses the detective has concluded that if the butler is telling the truth then so is the cook; the cook and the gardener cannot both be telling the truth; the gardener and the handyman are not both lying; and if the handyman is telling the truth then the cook is lying. For each of the four witnesses, can the detective determine whether that persion is telling the truth or lying Explain your reasoning.

Solution

Butler lying, Cook lying, Gardener can not determine, Handyman can not determine.


+ $$p_1$$: Butler is telling the truth.
+ $$p_2$$: Cook is telling the truth.
+ $$p_3$$: Gardener is telling the truth.
+ $$p_4$$: Handyman is telling the truth.

1. $$p_1 \rightarrow p_2$$
1. $$\neg p_2 \vee \neg p_3$$
1. $$p_3 \vee p_4$$
1. $$p_4 \rightarrow \neg p_2$$

Assign $$p_1 = T => p_2 = T = > p_3 = F => p_4 = T$$ conflict with Equation 4.

Assign $$p_1 = F, p_2 = T => p_3 = F => p_4 = T$$ conflict with Equation 4.

Assign $$p_1 = F, p_2 = F$$, $$p_3, p_4$$ can either true or false.
