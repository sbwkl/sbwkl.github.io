The police have three suspects for the murder of Mr.Cooper: Mr.Smith, Mr.Jones, and Mr.Williams. Smith, Jones, and Williams each declare that they did not kill Cooper. Smith also states that Cooper was a friend of Jones and that Williams disliked him. Jones also states that he did not know Cooper and that he was out of town the day Cooper was killed. Williams also states that he saw both Smith and Jones with Cooper the day of the killing and that either Smith or Jones must have killed him. Can you determine who the murderer was if 

1. one of the three men is guilty, the two innocent men are telling the truth, but the statements of the guilty man may or may not be true?
2. innocent men do not lie?

Solution

Smith kill Cooper or Williams kill Cooper.

+ p: Smith kill Cooper.
+ q: Jones kill Cooper.
+ r: Williams kill Cooper.

1. $$\neg q \wedge r$$
2. $$\neg q$$
3. $$p \vee q$$

Assign $$\neg q = F => \neg q \wedge r = F$$ conflict. so $$\neg q = T => q = F$$
