Freedonia has 50 senators. Each senator is either honest or corrupt. Suppose you know what at least one of the Freedonian senators is honest and that, given any two Freedonian senators, at least one is corrupt. Based on these facts, can you determine how many Freedonian senators are honest and how many are corrupt? If so, what is the anser?

Solution

1 honest, 49 corrupt.

$$p_1, p_2, ..., p_50$$ represent *i*th senator is honest.

1. $$\bigvee_{i=1}^n$$
1. $$\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1}\bigwedge_{j=i+1}^n(\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j)$$

Exactly one  $$p_i$$ is true.
