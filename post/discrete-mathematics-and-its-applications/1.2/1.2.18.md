Suppose that in Example 7 there are treasures in two of the three trunk. The inscriptions on Trunks 1, 2, and 3 are

1. This trunk is empty.
2. There is a treasure in Trunk1.
3. There is a treasure in Trunk2.

For each of these statements, determine whether the Queen who never lie could state this, and if so, which two trunks the treasures are in.

1. All the inscriptions are false.
2. Exactly one of the inscriptions is true.
3. Exactly two of the inscriptions are true.
4. All three inscriptions are true.

Solution

1. Can not
2. Trunk 1 & Trunk 3
3. Trunk 2 & (Trunk 1 or Trunk 3)
4. Can not

+ p<sub>1</sub>: The treasure is in Trunk 1.
+ p<sub>2</sub>: The treasure is in Trunk 2.
+ p<sub>3</sub>: The treasure is in Trunk 3.

1. $$\neg p_1$$
2. $$p_1$$
3. $$p_2$$

    a, b must has one false, one true
