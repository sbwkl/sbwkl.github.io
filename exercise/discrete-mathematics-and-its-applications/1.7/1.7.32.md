Show that these three statements are equivalent, where a and b are real numbers: (i) a is less than b, (ii) the average of a and b is greater than a, and (iii) the average of a and b is less than b.

Solution

+ $$p_1$$: a < b
+ $$p_2$$: (a + b) / 2 > a
+ $$p_3$$: (a + b) / 2 < b

**Proof $$p_1 \rightarrow p_2$$**

a < b, 2a < a + b, a < (a + b) / 2

**Proof $$p_2 \rightarrow p_3$$**

(a + b) / 2 > a, (a + b) / 2 + (b - a) / 2 > a + (b - a) / 2, b > (a + b) / 2

**Proof $$p_3 \rightarrow p_1$$**

(a + b) / 2 < b, a < b
