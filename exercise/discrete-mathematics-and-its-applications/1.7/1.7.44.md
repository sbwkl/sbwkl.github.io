Prove that these four statements about the integer n are equivalent: (i) $$n^2$$ is odd, (ii) 1 - n is even, (iii) $$n^3$$ is odd, (iv) $$n^2 + 1$$ is even.

**Proof $$p_1 \rightarrow p_2$$**

$$n^2$$ is odd, n is odd, n = 2k + 1, 1 - n = 2(-n), it is even

**Proof $$p_2 \rightarrow p_3$$**

1 - n = 2k, n = 2(-k) + 1, it is odd so $$n^3$$ is odd

**Proof $$p_3 \rightarrow p_4$$**

$$n^3$$ is odd, $$n^2$$ is odd, $$n^2 + 1$$ is even.

**Proof $$p_4 \rightarrow p_1$$**

$$n^2 + 1 = 2k, n^2 = 2(k - 1) + 1$$, it is even.
