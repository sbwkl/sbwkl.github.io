Show that if n is an integer and $$n^3 + 5$$ is odd, then n is even using

1. a proof by contraposition.
2. a proof by contradiction.

Solution

a. Assume n is odd. n = 2k + 1

$$n^3 + 5 = (2k + 1)^3 + 5 = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1 + 5 = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k + 3)$$, it is even.

b. Assume $$n^3 + 5$$ is odd, n is odd.

n is odd imply $$n^3 + 5$$ is even, contradiction.
