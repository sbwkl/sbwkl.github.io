Show that these statements about the integer x are equivalent: (i) 3x + 2 is even, (ii) x + 5 is odd, (iii) $$x^2$$ is even.

Solution

+ $$p_1$$: 3x + 2 is even.
+ $$p_2$$: x + 5 is odd.
+ $$p_3$$: $$x^2$$ is even.

**Proof $$p_1 \rightarrow p_2$$**

Assume $$p_2$$ is even

$$\begin{aligned}
& x + 5 = 2k \\
& x = 2k - 5 \\
& 3(2k - 5) + 2 = 6k - 13 = 2(3k - 7) + 1 
\end{aligned}$$

It is odd.

**Proof $$p_2 \rightarrow p_3$$**

$$\begin{aligned}
& x + 5 = 2k + 1 \\
& x = 2k - 4 \\
& x^2 = (2k - 4)^2 = 2(2(k - 2)^2)
\end{aligned}$$

It is even.

**Proof $$p_3 \rightarrow p_1$$**

$$x^2$$ is even, x is even

$$\begin{aligned}
& x = 2k \\
& 3x + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)
\end{aligned}$$

It is even.
