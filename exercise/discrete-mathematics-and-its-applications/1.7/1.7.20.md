Prove that if n is an integer and 3n + 2 is even, then n is even using

1. a proof by contraposition.
2. a proof by contradiction.

Solution

a. Assume n is odd, n = 2k + 1

3n + 2 = 3(2k + 1) + 2 = 3(3k + 2) + 1, it is odd.

b. Assume 3n + 2 is even, n is odd.

n is odd imply 3n + 2 is odd, contradiction.
