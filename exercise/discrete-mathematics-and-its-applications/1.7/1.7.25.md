Show that at least ten of any 64 days chosen must fall on the same day of the week.

Solution

Proof by Contradiction

p: At least ten of any 64 days chosen must fall on the same day of the week.

Assume p is false that at most 9 of any 64 days chosen must fall on the same day of the week, 7 * 9 = 63 contradiction.
