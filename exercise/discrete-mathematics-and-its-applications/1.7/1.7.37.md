Are these steps for finding the solutions of $$\sqrt{x + 3} = 3 - x$$ correct? (1) $$\sqrt{x + 3} = 3 - x$$ is given; (2) $$x + 3 = x^2 - 6x + 9$$, obtained by squaring both sides of (1); (3) $$0 = x^2 - 7x + 6$$, obtained by subtracting x + 3 from both sides of (2); (4) 0 = (x - 1)(x - 6), obtained by factoring the right-hand side of (3); (5) x = 1 or x = 6, which follows form (4) because ab = 0 implies that a = 0 or b = 0;

Solution

Incorrect

3 - x > 0
