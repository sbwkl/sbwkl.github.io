Show that if you pick three socks from a drawer containing just blue socks and black socks, you must get either a pair of blue socks or a pair of black socks.

Solution

Proof by Contradiction

+ p: You pick three socks from drawer containing just blue socks and black socks.
+ q: You must get either a pair of blue socks or a pair of black socks.

Assume $$p \rightarrow q$$ is false, p is true and q is false, you must get neither a pair of blue socks nor a pair of black socks. The drawer containing just blue socks and black socks, so you pick at most two socks, contradiction.
