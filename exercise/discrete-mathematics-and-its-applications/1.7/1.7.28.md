Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is even if and only if 7n + 4 is even.

Solution

+ p: n is even.
+ q: 7n + 4 is even.

**Proof $$p \rightarrow q$$**

n = 2k, 7n + 4 = 14k + 4 = 2(7k + 2) is even.

**Proof $$q \rightarrow p$$**

Assume p is false, n = 2k + 1, 7n + 4 = 7(2k + 1) + 4 = 14k + 13 = 2(7k + 6) + 1 is odd, q is false.
