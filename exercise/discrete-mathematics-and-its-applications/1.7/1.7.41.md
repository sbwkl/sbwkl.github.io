Prove that at least one of the real numbers $$a_1, a_2, ...,a_n$$ is greater than or equal to the average of these numbers. What kind of proof did you use?

Solution

Proof by Contradiction

+ p: At least one is greater than or equal to the average.
+ r: $$A = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n$$

Assume p is false, all of real number is less than the average.

$$a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n \lt (a_1 + a_2 + ..._+ a_n) / n + ... + (a_1 + a_2 + ..._+ a_n) = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n$$, it is contradiction.
