Prove or disprove that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

Solution

$$\neg p$$: The product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is rational.

+ A is rational number, A = m / n ($$m \ne 0, n \ne 0$$).
+ B is irrational number.
+ C is rational number, C = r / s.

AB = C

mB / n = r / s

B = nr / ms is rational number.
