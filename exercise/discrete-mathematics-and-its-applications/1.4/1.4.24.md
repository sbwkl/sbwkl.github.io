Translate in two ways each of these statements into logical expressions using predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives. First, let the domain consist of the students in your class and second, let it consist of all people.

1. Everyone in your class has a cellular phone.
1. Somebody in your class has seen a foreign movie.
1. There is a person in your class who cannot swim.
1. All students in your class can solve quadratic equations.
1. Some student in your class does not want to be rich.

Soltuion

+ P(x): x in your class
+ C(x): x has a cellular phone.
+ M(x): x has seen a foreign movie.
+ S(x): x can swim.
+ Q(x): x can solve quadratic equations.
+ R(x): x want to be rich

1. $$\forall x C(x)$$, $$\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow C(x))$$
1. $$\exist x M(x)$$, $$\exist x (P(x) \wedge M(x))$$
1. $$\exist \neg S(x)$$, $$\exist x (P(x) \wedge \neg S(x))$$
1. $$\forall x Q(x)$$, $$\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$$
1. $$\exist x \neg R(x)$$, $$\exist x (P(x) \wedge \neg R(x))$$
