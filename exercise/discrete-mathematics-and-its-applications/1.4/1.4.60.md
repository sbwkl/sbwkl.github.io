Suppose that Prolog facts are used to define the predicates mother(M, Y) and father(F, X), which represent that M is the mother of Y and F is the father of X, respectively. Give a Prolog rule to define the predicate grandfather(X, Y), which represents that X is the grandfather of Y. [Hint: You can write a disjunction in Prolog either by using a semicolon to separate predicates or by putting these predicates on separate lines.]

Solution

grandfather(X, Y) :- (father(X, P), father(P, Y)) ; (father(X, P), mother(P, Y))
