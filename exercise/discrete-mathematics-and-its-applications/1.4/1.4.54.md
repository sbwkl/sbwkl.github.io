As mentioned in the text, the notation $$\exist !x P(x)$$ denotes "There exists a unique x such that P(x) is true."
If the domain consists of all integers, what are the truth values of these statements?

1. $$\exist !x (x \lt 1)$$
2. $$\exist !x (x^2 = 1)$$
3. $$\exist !x (x + 3 = 2x)$$
4. $$\exist !x (x = x + 1)$$

Solution

1. false
2. false
3. true
4. false
