Solution

a. $$\forall x (M(x) \vee F(x)) \rightarrow E(x)$$

+ Domain: All passenger on an airline.
+ E(x): x qualifies as an elite flyer.
+ M(x): x flies more than 25,000 miles in a year.
+ F(x): x takes more than 25 flights during that year.

b. $$\forall x ((M(x) \wedge P(x, 3)) \vee (\neg M(x) \wedge P(x, 3.5)) \rightarrow Q(x))$$

+ Domain: All people.
+ M(x): x is a man.
+ Q(x): x qualifies for the marathon.
+ P(x, y): x's best previous time is less than y hours.

c. $$\forall x 
\bigg(\Big(C(x, 60) \vee \big(C(x, 45) \wedge T(x)\big)\Big) \wedge B(x)\bigg) \rightarrow D(x))$$

+ Domain: All student.
+ C(x, y): x take at least y hours.
+ T(x): x wreite a master's thesis.
+ B(x): x recive a grade no lower than a B in all required courses.
+ D(x): x receive a master's degree.

d. $$\exist x (C(x) \wedge A(x))$$
