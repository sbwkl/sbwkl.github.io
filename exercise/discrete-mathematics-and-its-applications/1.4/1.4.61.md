Exercises 61-64 are based on questions found in the book Symbolic Logic by Lewis Carroll.

**61.** Let P(x), Q(x), and R(x) be the statments "x is a professor," "x is ignorant," and "x is vain," respectively. Express each of these statements using quantifiers; Logical connectives; and P(x), Q(x), and R(x), where the domain consists of all people.

1. No professors are ignorant.
2. All ignorant people are vain.
3. No professors are vain.
4. Does (c) follow from (a) and (b)?

Solution

1. $$\neg \exist x (P(x) \wedge Q(x))$$
2. $$\forall x (Q(x) \rightarrow R(x))$$
3. $$\neg \exist x (P(x) \wedge R(x))$$
4. No
