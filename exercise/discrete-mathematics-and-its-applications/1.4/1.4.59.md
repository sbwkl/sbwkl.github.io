Suppose that Prolog facts are used to define the predicates mother(M, Y) and father(F, X), which represent that M is the mother of Y and F is the father of X, respectively. Give a Prolog rule to define the predicate sibling(X, Y), which represents that X and Y are siblings (that is, have the same mother and the same father).

Solution

sibling(X, Y) :- (mother(M, X), mother(M, Y)), (father(F, X), father(F, Y))
