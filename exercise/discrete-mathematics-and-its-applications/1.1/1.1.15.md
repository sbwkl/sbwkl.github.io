Let ```p``` and ```q``` be the propositions

+ p: You drive over 65 miles pre hour.
+ q: You get a speeding ticket.

Write these propositions using p and q and logical connectives (including negations).

1. You do not drive over 65 miles per hour.
2. You dirve over 65 miles per hour, but you do not get a speeding ticket.
3. You will get a speeding ticket if you dirve over 65 miles per hour.
4. If you do not drive over 65 miles per hour, then you will not get a speeding ticket.
5. Driving over 65 miles per hour is sufficient for getting a speeding ticket.
6. you get a speeding ticket, but you do not drive over 65 miles per hour.
7. Whenever you get a speeding ticket, you are driving over 65 miles per hour.

Solution

1. $$\neg p$$
2. $$p \wedge \neg q$$
3. $$p \rightarrow q$$
4. $$\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$$
5. $$p \rightarrow q$$
6. $$q \wedge \neg p$$
7. $$q \rightarrow p$$
