Use Exercise 44 to construct a compound proposition that is true if and only if exactly one of the proposition $$p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$$ is true. [Hint: combine the proposition that is true if and only if at least one of $$p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$$ is true.]

Solution 

$$I = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} \bigwedge_{j=i+1}^n (\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j)$$

$$P = \bigvee_{i=1}^n p_i$$

$$I \wedge P = [\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} \bigwedge_{j=i+1}^n (\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j)] \wedge (\bigvee_{i=1}^n p_i)$$
