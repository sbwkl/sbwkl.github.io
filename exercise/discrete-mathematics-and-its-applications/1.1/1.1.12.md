2. $$p\vee q$$
3. $$\neg p \wedge q$$
4. $$q \rightarrow p$$
5. $$\neg q \rightarrow \neg q$$
6. $$\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$$
7. $$p\leftrightarrow q$$
8. $$\neg q \vee(\neg p \wedge q)$$

Solution

1. The election is not decided.
2. The election is decided and the votes have been counted.
