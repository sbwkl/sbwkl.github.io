Support there are signs on the doors to two rooms. The sign on the first door reads "In this room there is a lady, and in the other one there is a tiger"; and the sign on the second door reads "In one of these rooms, there is a lady, and in one of them there is a tigher." Suppose that you know that one of these signs is true and the other is false. Behind which door is the lady?

Solution

The second room.

+ p: The first room is the lady.
+ q: The second room is the lady.

1. $$p \wedge \neg q$$
2. $$(p \wedge \neg q) \vee (\neg p \wedge q)$$

$$\neg p \wedge q = T => q = T, p = F$$
