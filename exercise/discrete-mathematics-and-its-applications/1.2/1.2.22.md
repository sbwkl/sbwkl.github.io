When planning a party you want to know whom to invite. Among the people you would like to invite are three touchy firends. You know that if Jasmine attends, she will become unhappy if Samir is there, Simir will attend only if Kanti will be there, and Kanti will not attend unless Jasine also does. Which combinations of these three friends can you invite so as not to make someone unhappy?

Solution

1. Invite Jasmine
2. Invite Kanti

+ $$p_1$$: Invite Jasmine.
+ $$p_2$$: Invite Samir.
+ $$p_3$$: Invite Kanti.

1. $$\neg (p_1 \wedge p_2)$$
2. $$p_2 \rightarrow p_3$$
3. $$p_1 \rightarrow \neg p_3$$
