When three professors are seated in a restaurant, the hostess asks them: "Does everyone want coffee?" The first professor says "I do not know." The second professor then says "I do not know." Finally, the third professor says "No, not everyone wants coffee." The hostess comes back and gives coffee to the professors who want it. How did she figure out who wanted coffee?

Solution

The first and the second

+ $$p_1$$: The first professor want coffee.
+ $$p_2$$: The second professor want coffee.
+ $$p_3$$: The third professor want coffee.

Hostess asks them: $$p_1 \wedge p_2 \wedge p_3$$

The first professor says "I do not know" means $$p_1 = T$$, if $$p_1 = F" he should say "No"
