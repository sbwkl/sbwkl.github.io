Suppose that in Example 7, the inscriptions on Trunks 1, 2, and 3 are 

1. The treasure is in Trunk 3.
2. The treasure is in Trunk 1.
3. This Trunk is empty.

For each of these statements, determine whether the Queen who never lies could state this, and if so, which trunk the treasure is in.

1. All the inscriptions are false.
2. Exactly one of the inscriptions is true.
3. Exactly two of the inscriptions are true.
4. All three inscriptions are true.

Solution

1. Can not
2. Trunk 2 or Trunk 3
3. Trunk 1
4. Can not

+ p<sub>1</sub>: The treasure is in Trunk 1.
+ p<sub>2</sub>: The treasure is in Trunk 2.
+ p<sub>3</sub>: The treasure is in Trunk 3.

1. $$p_3$$
2. $$p_1$$
3. $$\neg p_3$$

    a, c must has one false, one true
