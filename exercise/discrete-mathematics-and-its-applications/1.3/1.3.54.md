In this exercise we will show that {$$\downarrow$$} is a functionally complete collection of logical operators.

1. Show that $$p \downarrow p$$ is logically equivalent to $$\neg p$$.
2. Show that $$(p \downarrow q) \downarrow (p \downarrow q)$$ is logically equivalent to $$p \vee q$$.
3. Conclude from parts (a) and (b), and Exercise 49, that {$$\downarrow$$} is a functionally complete collection of logical operators.

Solution

a. 

$$\begin{aligned}
p \downarrow p 
&\equiv \neg(p \vee p) \\
&\equiv \neg p
\end{aligned}$$

b. 

$$\begin{aligned}
(p \downarrow q) \downarrow (p \downarrow q) 
&\equiv \neg (p \downarrow q) \\
&\equiv \neg (\neg (p \vee q)) \\
&\equiv p \vee q
\end{aligned}$$

c. 

By Exercise 49, given a compound proposition p, we can write down a proposition q that is logically equivalent to p and involves only $$\neg$$ and $$\vee$$. By parts (a) and (b), we can eliminate all $$\neg s$$ by replacing each occurrence of $$\neg p_1$$ with $$p \downarrow p$$, and eliminate all $$\vee s$$ by replacing each occurrence of $$p_1 \vee p_2$$ with $$(p_1 \downarrow p_2) \downarrow (p_1 \downarrow p_2)$$, $$p_1, p_2$$ can be compound proposition.
