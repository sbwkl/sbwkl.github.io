Explain the steps in the construction of the compound proposition given in the text that asserts that every column of a 9 * 9 Sudoku puzzle contains every number.

Solution

$$\bigwedge_{j=1}^9 \bigwedge_{n=1}^9 \bigvee_{i=1}^9p(i,j,n)$$

Every column: $$\bigwedge_{n=1}^9 \bigvee_{i=1}^9p(i,j,n)$$
