Show that the negation of an unsatisfiable compound proposition is a tautology and the negation of a compound proposition that is a tautology is unsatisfiable.

Solution

p is an unsatisfiable compound proposition $$p \equiv F$$, $$\neg p \equiv \neg F \equiv T$$ is a tautology.

q is a tautology $$q \equiv T$$, $$\neg q \equiv \neg T \equiv F$$ is an unsatisfiable compound proposition.
