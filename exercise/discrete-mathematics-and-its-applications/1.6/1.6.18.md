What is wrong with this argument? "Let S(x, y) be "x is shorter than y." Given the premise $$\exist s S(s, Max)$$, it follows that S(Max, Max). Then by existential generalization it follows $$\exist x S(x, x)$$, so that someone is shorter than himself.

Solution

There is A shorter than Max, but may not be Max.
