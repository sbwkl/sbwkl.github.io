Show that the argument form with premises $$p_1, p_2,..., p_n$$ and conclusion $$q \rightarrow r$$ is valid if the argument form with premises $$p_1, p_2,..., p_n, q$$, and conclusion r is valid.

Soluiton

If q = F, $$q \rightarrow r$$ is valid.

If q = T, then r = T (The second argument form), $$q \rightarrow r$$ is valid.
