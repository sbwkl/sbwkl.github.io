Show that the equivalence $$p \wedge \neg p \equiv F$$ can be derived using resolution together with the fact that a conditional statement with a false hypothesis is true. [Hint: Let q = r = F in resolution.]

Soluiton

By Resolution $$((p \vee F) \wedge (\neg p \vee F)) \rightarrow (F \vee F) \equiv (p wedge \neg p) \rightarrow F$$ is a tautology, so $$p \wedge \neg p \equiv F$$.
