For each of these arguments, explain which rules of inference are used for each step.

1. "Linda, a student in this class, owns a red convertible. Everyone who owns a red convertible has gotten at least one speeding ticket. Therefore, someone in this class has gotten a speeding ticket."
2. "Each of five roommates, Melissa, Aaron, Ralph, Veneesha, and Keeshawn, has taken a course in discrete mathematics. Every student who has taken a course in discrete mathematics can take a course in algorithms. Therefore, all five roommates can take a course in algorithms next year."
3. "All movies produced by John Sayles are wonderful. John Sayles produced a movie about coal miners. Therefore, there is a wonderful movie about coal miners."
4. "There is someone in this class who has been to France. Everyone who goes to France visits the Louvre. Therefore, someone in this class has visited the Louvre."

Solution

1. Universal instantiation, Modus ponens, Existential generalization.
   1. $$R(Linda)$$
   2. $$\forall x (R(x) \rightarrow \exist y T(y))$$
   3. $$T(a)$$
   4. $$\exist x T(x)$$
2. Hypothetical syllogism, Universal generalization.
   1. $$\forall x (R(x) \rightarrow D(x))$$
   2. $$\forall x (D(x) \rightarrow A(x))$$
   3. For arbitrary a $$R(a) \rightarrow A(x)$$
   4. $$\forall x (R(x) \rightarrow A(x))$$
3. Universal instantiation, Existential instantiation, Simplification, Conjunction, Existential generalization.
   1. $$\forall x (J(x) \rightarrow W(x))$$
   2. $$\exist x (J(x) \wedge C(x))$$
   3. $$W(a) \wedge C(a)$$
   4. $$\exist x (W(x) \wedge C(x))$$
4. Universal instantiation, Existential instantiation, Simplification, Modus ponens, Conjunction, Existential generalization.
   1. $$\exist x (C(x) \wedge F(x))$$
   2. $$\forall x (F(x) \rightarrow V(x))$$
   3. $$C(a) \wedge V(a)$$
   4. $$\exist x (C(x) \wedge V(x))$$
