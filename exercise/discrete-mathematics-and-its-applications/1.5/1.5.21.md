Use predicates, quantifiers, logical connectives, and mathematical operators to express the statement that every positive integer is the sum of the squares of four integers.

Solution

$$\forall y (y \gt 0 \rightarrow \exist x_1 \exist x_2 \exist x_3 \exist x_4 (y = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2))$$
