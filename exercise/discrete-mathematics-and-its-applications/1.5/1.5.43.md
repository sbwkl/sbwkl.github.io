Use quantifiers and logical connectives to express the fact that every linear polynomial (that is , polynomial of degree 1) with real coefficients and where the coefficient of x is nonzero, has exactly one real root.

Solution

$$\forall a (a \ne 0 \rightarrow \forall b \exist x \forall w (x = w \leftrightarrow aw + b = 0))$$
