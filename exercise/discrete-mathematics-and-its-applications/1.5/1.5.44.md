Use quantifiers and logical connectives to express the fact that a quadratic polynomial with real number coefficients has at most two real roots.

Solution

$$\forall a \forall b \forall c (a \ne 0 \wedge b \ne 0 \rightarrow \exist x_1 \exist x_2 \forall x_3 ((x_3 = x_1 \vee x_3 = x_2) \leftrightarrow ax_3^2 + bx_3 + c = 0))$$
