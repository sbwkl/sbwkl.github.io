Let S(x) be the predicate "x is a student," F(x) the predicate "x is a faculty member," and A(x, y) the predicate "x has asked y a question," where the domain consists of all people associated with your school. use quantifiers to express each of these statements.

1. Lois has asked Professor Michaels a question.
2. Every student has asked Professor Gross a question.
3. Every faculty member has either asked Professor Miller a question or been asked a question by Professor Miller.
4. Some student has not asked any faculty member a question.
5. There is a faculty member who has never been asked a question by a student.
6. Some student has asked every faculty member a question.
7. There is a faculty member who has asked every other faculty member a question.
8. Some student has never been asked a question by a faculty member.

Solution

1. A(Lois, Professor Michaels)
2. $$\forall x (S(x) \rightarrow A(x, Professor Gross))$$
3. $$\forall x (F(x) \rightarrow (A(x, Professor Miller) \vee A(Professor Miller, x)))$$
4. $$\exist x (S(x) \wedge \forall y (F(y) \rightarrow \neg A(x, y)))$$
5. $$\exist x (F(x) \wedge \neg \exist y (S(y) \wedge A(y, x)))$$
6. $$\exist x (S(x) \wedge \forall y (F(y) \rightarrow A(x, y)))$$
7. $$\forall x \forall y ((x \ne y \wedge F(x) \wedge F(y)) \rightarrow A(x, y))$$
8. $$\exist x (S(x) \wedge \forall y (F(y) \rightarrow \neg A(y, x)))$$
