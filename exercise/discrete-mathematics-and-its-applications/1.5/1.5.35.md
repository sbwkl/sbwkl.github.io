Find a common domain for the variables x, y, z, and w for which the statement $$\forall x \forall y \forall z \exist w ((w \ne x) \wedge (w \ne y) \wedge (w \ne z))$$ is true and another common domain for these variables for which it is false.

Solution

Domain for true: {1, 2, 3, 4}, element bigger then three.

Domain for false: {1, 2, 3}, element less than or equal to three.
