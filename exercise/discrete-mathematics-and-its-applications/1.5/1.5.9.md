Let L(x, y) be the statement "x loves y," where the domain for both x and y consists of all people in the world. Use quantifiers to express each of these statements.

1. Everybody loves Jerry.
1. Everybody loves somebody.
1. There is somebody whom everybody loves.
1. Nobody loves everybody.
1. There is somebody whom Lydia does not love.
1. There is somebody whom no one loves.
1. There is exactly one person whom everybody loves.
1. There are exactly two people whom lynn loves.
1. Everyone loves himself or herself.
1. There is someone who loves no one besides himself or herself.

Soluiton

1. $$\forall x L(x, Jerry)$$
2. $$\forall x \exist y L(x, y)$$
3. $$\exist y \forall x L(x, y)$$
4. $$\neg \exist x \forall y L(x, y)$$
5. $$\exist y \neg L(Lydia, y)$$
6. $$\exist y \forall x \neg L(x, y)$$
7. $$\exist y \forall x L(x, y) \wedge \exist z ((y \ne z) \rightarrow \neg \forall x L(x, z))$$
    
    (**X**) Refer: $$\exist x (\forall y L(y,x) \wedge \forall z ((\forall w L(w,z)) \rightarrow z = x))$$

8. $$\exist y \exist z ((x \ne y) \wedge L(Lynn, y) \wedge L(Lynn, z)) \wedge \neg \exist r (r \ne y) \wedge (r \ne z) \wedge L(Lynn, r))$$
9.  $$\forall x L(x, x)$$
10. $$\exist x \forall y (L(x, x) \wedge \neg L(x, y))$$

    (**X**) Refer: $$\exist x \forall y (L(x, y) \leftrightarrow x = y)$$
