2. There is a student in this class who owns a personal computer.
3. Every student in this class has taken at least one computer science course.
4. There is a student in this class who has taken at least one course in computer science.
5. Every student in this class has been in every builing on campus.
6. There is a student in this class who has been in every room of at least one building on campus.

Solution

a. $$forall x P(x, discrete mathematics)$$

+ Domain: All computer science student.
+ P(x, y): x needs y.

b. $$\exist x P(x, personal computer)$$

+ Domain: All students in this class.
+ P(x, y): x own y.

c. $$\forall x \exist y T(x, y)$$

+ Domain: x - All students in this class, y - All computer science course.
+ T(x, y): x taken y.

d. $$\exist x \exist y T(x, y)$$

+ Domain: x - All students in this class, y - All computer scinece cours.
+ T(x, y): x taken y.

e. $$\forall x \forall y P(x, y)$$

+ Domain: x - All students in this class, y - All building on campus.
+ P(x, y): x has been in y.

f. $$\exist x \exist z \forall y (B(y, z) \rightarrow P(x, y))$$

+ Domain: x - All students in this class, y - All rooms , z - All building on campus.
+ P(x, y): x has been in y.
+ B(y, z): y in z.

g. $$\forall x \forall z \exist y (B(y, z) \wedge P(x, y))$$

+ Domain: x - All students in this class, y - All rooms, z - All building on campus.
+ P(x, y): x has been in y.
+ B(y, z): y in z.
